# 2D-Computer-Vision-Metrics
## Introduction
This repository contains the examples for my blog article [The Metrics in 2D Computer Vision: Binary Classification, 
Object Detection, and Image Segmentation](). 

There are three examples:
1. *example1.py* shows how to use the **BoundingBox class** for storing the data for bounding boxes used in Object 
Detection and **compute the IoU between two bounding boxes**.
2. *example2.py* shows how to **plot precision-recall curve**, **plot BoundingBox objects on images**, and **compute 
PASCAL-VOC-style mAP** (11-points-interpolation method and all-points-interpolation method).
3. *example3.py* shows how to **compute the IoU between two masks**.

All the functions and classes are stored in the *lib* folder.
